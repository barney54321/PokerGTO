# PokerGT

This is a single-player web version of Texas Holdem that at any point in time tells you what the optimal move would be. 

The game plays like regular poker. Initially there are 6 players at the table, each with a pot of 500 chips. Blinds are 
5/10. You play poker normally, being able to skip through the moves of the opponents. Every new hand uses the full deck 
reshuffled. You play until all but one player have gone bust.

The main difference between this and any other standard poker game is that whenever the player is required to perform
an action (e.g. fold, check, call, raise, etc), they can click on the GT button that tells them what game theory says 
would be optimal. This should basically just show the percentage chance that you have the best cards on the table, what 
the chances are that someone who hasn't folded has better cards, etc, and what you should do as a result. I do not know 
any poker game theory, so research will be required to do this.

The graphics do not need to be amazing, just sufficient to see what's going on and make all the right moves.
